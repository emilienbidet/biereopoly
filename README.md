Last christmass, I saw the [Biereo'poly](https://www.lavantgardiste.com/jeux-puzzles/7414-biere-opoly.html) drinking game.

🥵 45€ for 1 printed wood plank, 4 caps and 1 dice...

I created my own with Figma and printed it for 10€
- 2€ wood plank 
- 8€ printing (You can find cheaper)
- A dice from another game
- Caps of the beers in progress

Feel free to duplicate, customize and print it on whatever you want.

Tag me on twitter with a picture of your version customized ✌🏻
